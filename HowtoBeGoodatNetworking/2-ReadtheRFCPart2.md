# "Read the RFC" Part 2

One of the best things about RFCs is that they will have information
you'd never be able to find on Wikipedia or a normal reference. Skim the
DNS RFC to answer some obscure questions. I won't give you the RFC for
this, go find it.

1.  What is the TC bit?
2.  Would you describe the TC bit as... boolean? What is a bool?
3.  In the header of a message, how many bits from the ID field is the
    TC bit?

Congratulations, you are, at this exact moment in time, the world's 3rd
or 4th most knowledgeable person about TC bits.

Okay now you are about 10th.

Alright now, time to completely forget it. There's no need to keep that
kind of stuff floating in your brain when you can just look it up.

Let's move on to learning more important things, like reading the
"Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers" for
fun. I promise this one is shorter.
