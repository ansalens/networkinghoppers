# Introduction

Hopper's Roppers is a website dedicated to providing the best training possible for students who are new to the field. One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses.

This is the full text of our Practical Networking course.

This course is all about getting hands on with networking tools to learn networking concepts. Guarantee you won't find something better for building mental models.

This site is generated from a course hosted at:
