So if you're encrypted, you're good right? Not so fast. Every digital
interaction online creates something known as metadata. Metadata is
everything ***but*** the message, which means it includes when, where,
and who you are talking to, and even how much. Metadata is created every
time you send an email, make a phone call, or visit a website, because
even if nobody is logging the content of what you are doing, someone is
probably recording metadata.

This metadata can be stored by your internet provider, your cell
carrier, the messaging apps you are using, your VPN service... your
metadata is everywhere.

Read this from the EFF on why metadata matters:

How much does metadata matter to you? Well you can make that decision
based on your threat model. If you don't want people to know who you are
talking to and how often, metadata matters.

As former Director of the NSA and CIA, General Michael Hayden once said
"We kill people based on metadata". That's more of a problem for
terrorists than you, but metadata fits into some people's threat
profiles.

Assignment:

1.  Describe the metadata created by you connecting to Facebook and
    sending a picture of yourself to your friend.
