If you make a request to a website or send/receive any data across the
internet, you have given your router's IP address. This request can take
any form, from a visiting a link, viewing an image hosted there, or
being redirected through a short link. You can also be tricked into
opening a file that sends a request out to the internet, running a
program which profiles your computer and sends out a request, or even
running a terrible DDOS tool that makes no attempt to hide that it is
running on your own network. An attacker can use these requests to
identify someone through a 3rd party service.

Tasks:

-   Visit
    <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/more-info-about-you/" rel="noopener"
    target="_blank">http://www.whatsmyip.org/more-info-about-you/</a>
-   How much information did they know about you?
-   Use this site to shorten a URL and send it to a friend to get their
    IP <https://iplogger.org/shortener/?>
    -   Tell them in advance you are doing this! Even better, invite
        them to join Roppers!
