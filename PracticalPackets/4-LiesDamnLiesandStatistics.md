Steps:

1.  Begin capturing on your external interface. 
2.  Visit [hoppersroppers.org](//hoppersroppers.org) with your web
    browser. Click around for a bit. 
3.  End the capture.

Tasks:

1.  Open up the [Statistics
    menu](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChUseStatisticsMenuSection.html)
    in your Wireshark 
2.  Check out the [Protocol
    Hierarchy](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChStatHierarchy.html).
    What are the top 10 protocols listed? Anything interesting in
    there? 
3.  Check out the [Conversations
    view](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChStatConversations.html#ChStatConversationsWindow).
    Go to the TCP tab and sort by number of packets sent. Play around
    with it a bit. What was the largest conversation during this
    capture?
4.  What were the most common endpoints? Roppers is probably first, but
    what were \#2 and \#3?
5.  There is plenty more in the Statistics Menu so play around a bit and
    try to use this information to figure out what happened in your
    browsing session.
