# Computer Networks Crash Course

So obviously a 12 minute video won't teach you everything you need, but
I think it is a great way to get our brains tuned to what we will be
learning about over the rest of the course. Think of it like
scaffolding, except, instead of starting from the bottom, in this case
we are using this video to plan where the scaffolding goes, and how
high.Â

It's good material, but don't get too distracted and keep watching, not
all of the videos in this series are as useful. Take some notes and keep
moving, don't worry about perfect understanding.
