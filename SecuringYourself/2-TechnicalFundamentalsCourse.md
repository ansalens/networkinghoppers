# Technical Fundamentals Course

Next up, the [Roppers Technical Fundamentals
Course](https://www.roppers.org/courses/technical-security-fundamentals)!

This course goes over the more technical side of security and will
require a more in depth understanding of Linux and operating systems. If
you have not done our flagship course, [Roppers Computing
Fundamentals](https://www.roppers.org/courses/fundamentals) you should!

  

Stay stoked,Â 

Dennis
