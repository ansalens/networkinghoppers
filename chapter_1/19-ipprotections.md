## Hiding Your IP and Circumventing Censorship


So now we know we need to add something in between ourselves and the things we are trying to visit. There are a varieties of ways to do that, but the most important bit is that we are able to trust the hops we are using, because a malicious hop is almost as bad as no hop at all. 

First, some vocab.

* Port Forward
* Proxy
* Proxychains

## Circumventing Proxies and Going Right to the Source

Remember honey tokens? Or just malware. That calls home real nice. There's also a fine line in the middle refered to by some as a "Network Investigative Tool" which is basically just a system profiler that calls home and deletes itself.

## What Can Be Done with an IP

   * Identify general location 
   * DDOS their router 
   * Hack their Router
   * Court orders to ISPs
   * Threaten to give it to police so they can go get a court order
