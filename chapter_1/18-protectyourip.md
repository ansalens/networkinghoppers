If you make a request to a website or send/receive any data across the internet, you have given your router's IP address. This request can take any form, from a visiting a link, viewing an image hosted there, or being redirected through a short link. You can also be tricked into opening a file that sends a request out to the internet, running a program which profiles your computer and sends out a request, or even running a terrible DDOS tool that makes no attempt to hide that it is running on your own network. An attacker can use these requests to identify someone through a 3rd party service.

 Now to add what is called a proxy. Basically, this is a server you send a request to that routes all the traffic through them first, then passes it on to you. The critical thing to remember is that this extra hop added by the proxy, although it obfuscates your IP from the end target, does not hide it from the servers providing the service. They can see all of your traffic, and can do whatever they want with it. Your extra hops will create logs, and all those logs can still be used if someone gets them.
 
Tasks:

* Visit <https://hide.me/en/proxy>
* Use their proxy to visit <http://www.whatsmyip.org/more-info-about-you/>
* How much information do they have about you now?

Adding an extra hop works, but it needs to be done intelligently, and certainly not through a sketchy website which provides it for free. Don't use free proxies, because if the product is free.... you are the product.
