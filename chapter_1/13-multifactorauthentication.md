You could probably get a couple, and then set it up with <https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/>. Google's Advanced Protection is the best you can get right now, but you probably don't need it. My philosophy is I can't properly tell people to do things for their security if I don't do it myself and understand the pain points. For the record, I don't use it. Too inconvenient when I'm on a ship and can't log in to things. 

A brief note: Cell phone text messagesaka SMS are commonly used for multifactor auth. These are not great, because 
a) someone can steal your phone number and get the texts sent to them  <https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/>
b) intercept of text messages <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/ss7-hack-explained-mobile-phone-vulnerability-snooping-texts-calls>

However, those things are not in your threat model unless you are famous or have cryptocurrency wallets.

Another note: Just because you have 2 factor doesn't mean you can't get phished for it!
