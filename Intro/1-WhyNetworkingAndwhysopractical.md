# Why Networking? And why so practical?

Networking is hands down the most important thing to understand in
security, and still, people just kind of fumble through it. One of the
reasons this stuff is so hard is because most people just don't spend
enough time with it to get an innate knowledge of what is going on,
which makes things hard to conceptualize. 

The other reason, and I think the main reason, is because all the
courses about networking focus on memorizing random things and doing
calculations, but don't spend any time looking at packets or generating
packets. It's like if you were trying to learn how to be a carpenter by
looking at furniture. Stupid. 

People waste too much damn time "learning" networking. This course is
here to fix that. Build your mental models now, learn what is actually
happening, then save the memorization for later. Everything is easier
when you understand the context.
