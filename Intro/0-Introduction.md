This course will teach you the base knowledge required to become a
networking stud and will guide you through a variety of networking CTF
challenges. You will do a bunch of packet capture problems, some packet
crafting, and a few other miscellaneous networking shenanigans. It's
hilariously practical, and ignores nearly all the finer parts of
networking... sorry.Â 

We will spend a little time going over the fundamentals, but most of the
time will be wrapping your head around how to make the packets dance and
what it looks like going over the wire. If you want an academic view
into the protocols and how packets bop around, take a college course or
read a book. This course is for rolling up your sleeves and getting your
hands dirty.

Welcome to the show!
