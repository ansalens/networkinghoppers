# Secure Yourself Now
You signed up for this course to improve yourself, to learn how to secure yourself online, and to help others. That's what this section is dedicated to. If you finish this section and don't do anything else, your participation in this course will be a success in my eyes.

Of course, I would prefer you to continue in the course, but I'm glad you are here, and I hope you stick around.

If you have experience in this field you might know everything I am about to tell you, but I'm going to tell you it again. If you have strong opinions on things like this, you might not like that my advice defaults to a Windows OS and using Chrome. I don't have strong opinions on this, but they have the most market share and I am writing this for a very broad audience. If you are on a Mac, already running Linux, or use a different browser than Chrome, read along and just know some of the specifics will not apply to you.


While some of this stuff might seem obvious, doing the fundamentals will make you significantly more secure than the average internet citizen. We're not trying to turn you into a cyber warlord yet, we'll start with being a hard target and generally informed.
