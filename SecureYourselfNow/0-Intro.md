Hey! I'm Dennis the person behind Hopper's Roppers.

This is the Roppers Security Fundamentals course. It combines theory and
practical application, and combined with its sister course [Roppers
Technical Security
Fundamentals](https://www.roppers.org/courses/technical-security-fundamentals)
provides the strongest base possible to become a security expert.Â 

These courses will teach students about risk, threat modeling, and how
they can defend themselves and others online. This course is somewhat
unique as I don't talk about "hacking" until the very end because all
things considered, ***hackers do not present the greatest risk to the
average person.*** We start by securing our physical presence and
devices, move to passwords and authentication, learn just enough about
network security, then finally move on to hacking and malware and all
the other things. This course is about teaching practical skills backed
up by theory; not advanced persistent threats and fighting off malware.

It doesn't have an official place in the
<a href="https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">roadmap</a> I use to guide students towards the best
resources available, but it is an essential part of your development as
a security professional.

## Pre-Requisites

Our Computing Fundamentals course is recommended, but not required. This
is not an extremely technical course, there is no requirement to know
Linux or advanced networking.

Welcome to the show!
