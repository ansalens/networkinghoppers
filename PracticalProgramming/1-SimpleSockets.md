Sockets are the foundational piece of networking and are pretty damn
complicated. On the plus side, we have python, and like all things,
python makes them an absolute joy to work with. 

Work through this tutorial. <https://realpython.com/python-sockets/> 

As you go through, make sure to have Wireshark open and filter on the
correct ports so you see the correct data. Experiment with the server
and client to see how you can break it and what it looks like in
Wireshark when that happens. 

  

For your assignment, describe the order of socket setup between a server
and a client, and then how the socket closes.
