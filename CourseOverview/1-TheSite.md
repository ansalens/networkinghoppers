# The Site
# Hopper's Roppers 

This site was originally created to help train new members of my CTF team. Once I got the curriculum to where I wanted it to be I shared it with the world. My goal is for this site to become the best place on the internet for a beginner to take their first steps into the field. I already think that it is, but my goal is for this to become the place that everyone is confident recommending as their go-to.

The site is named after Grace Hopper because she is my favorite person in computing history. You might have heard of her before, but if not, [click here](https://news.yale.edu/2017/02/10/grace-murray-hopper-1906-1992-legacy-innovation-and-service) to learn about a pretty awesome person.
