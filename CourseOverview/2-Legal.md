Sorry, time for some boring legal things! 

## Community Guidelines
Our community guidelines are available here: <https://www.hoppersroppers.org/guidelines.html>. I'll enforce them even if you didn't read them, so please read them over. Long story short, if you do anything that makes the community feel unsafe to any member, you will be banned. If you mention anything illegal, you will be banned. If you are an asshole, I'll call you an asshole, and then I'll ban you.

## Legal
Unsurprisingly, in this course, you will learn some things that could be used to do bad things. You might not think they're bad things at the time, and they might seem like funny pranks, but the laws against hacking are very vague. 

As mentioned up in the community guidelines, if you even remotely talk about conducting illegal activities in a hypothetical manner, I will ban you on the spot. Makes my life easier when I don't have to worry about nuance.
