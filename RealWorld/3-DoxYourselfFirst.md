Dropping Dox, now known as Doxing, originated in the late 90s in hacker
circles as a way of targeting individuals by releasing documents (dox)
about their personal information to the web. As many of these hackers
who were doxed were criminals, doxing could have a pretty serious effect
on them.

Doxing has spread to the rest of the internet and thanks to the ease of
use of search engines, is now a common way for a digitally-minded
harasser to invade the privacy of someone. Doxing is unfortunately
legal, even when it is pretty clearly harassment or stalking.

In the modern world everyone gets doxed, it's better to do it yourself
first, but it is even better to have strict compartmentalization. Just
one slip up that ties together identities can be enough.
