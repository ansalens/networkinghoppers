# Linux Password Reset
To demonstrate how easy it is to break into a computer you have physical access to we are going to do a password reset on your Linux VM.

I actually had to do this attack the week before I wrote this section because I accidentally corrupted the password file on my box (protip: don't test the rootkit you are writing on your actual machine) and couldn't get back in. Had to do this reset to make a new account and recover everything. See! Hacking is Useful!  

This maneuver is generally known as a "Grub Bootloader attack".
