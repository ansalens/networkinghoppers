# Outdated Extensions and Permissions

A long time ago, you might have used a FB addon that made cool faces on
your profile picture, or a Chrome calendar extension that allowed you to
remember your mom's birthday. Well, now the original coders got bored
and sold it to some criminals who are using it to steal your shit. At
one point they were good, now they are bad, and you need to get them off
your shit. Most of the time, Malwarebytes can catch extensions on your
computer, or Chrome will identify them as bad. Windows Defender does not
consider Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) malware, so they rarely
remove those. Identifying evil browser extensions will almost always be
caught by the browser developers before you realize it so honestly,
don't worry too hard.  
  
However, you still gotta get the addons and permissions out of your
accounts.  
  
All of these tasks are Googleable.  
  
Tasks:  
1. Check email for devices you have given permissions to.  
2. Check email for services you have given permissions to  
3. Check FB for addons  
4. Check Twitter for addons  
5. Check any other sites you can think of for addons.
