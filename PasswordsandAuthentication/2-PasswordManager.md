# Password Manager

All is not lost however, luckily you do not have to memorize hundreds of
high entropy passwords or carry them around in a locked diary. Password
managers provide the ability to generate and store secure passwords
across devices, all controlled by a single master password. This means
you only need to know one password, and the rest can be pseudo-randomly
generated.

My first recommendation to students when they want to secure themselves
now is to start using a password manager such as LastPass, Keepass, or
1Password. Even Apple and Google have built in ones for your browser
these days. If you haven't heard of them before, what password managers
do is recommend randomized passwords to you when you sign up to a site,
store the password, and then autofill the password for you when you are
logging into the site the next time. This is very helpful because the
human brain can only remember so many passwords, which leads us to reuse
passwords across different sites. The problem with this is that if you
use the same password on all of your accounts, if someone steals that
password at one site, they now have the ability to log into any of your
accounts. Password managers help you maintain track of a bunch of
strong, unique passwords, which limits the most likely threat that you
have online.

I recommend using <a href="https://lastpass.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">LastPass</a>. There's plenty of other great password
managers out there, plenty of them really, Keepass is a great free one,
but I've been using this one forever and that is the main reason I
recommend it. Convince your friends and family to use password managers.
Again, I totally get if you don't want to do this now, just skip it.

Tasks:

1.  Submit a 2-3 sentence statement trying to convince my grandma to use
    a password manager.
2.  <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936#Explanation"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank">Relevant XKCD</a> What password has
    2^44 bits of entropy?
3.  Install a password manager if you haven't already
4.  Make your password for your password manager something you have
    never used before. Now that everything will be stored in the same
    location, you need to protect this as much as possible.
5.  My recommendation is to write this password down in a few places
    that you will not lose, but that will not be obviously related your
    password manager if someone finds it. Or just remember it. I
    recommend writing it down.
