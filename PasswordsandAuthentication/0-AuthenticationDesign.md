# Authentication Design

We discussed authentication earlier as a pillar of security, and while
there are other forms of authentication when it comes down to it,
passwords provide the vast majority. Whether that is good or bad is up
for nerds to debate, but it's the way that it is, so let's spend some
time learning about passwords.

But before that, let's learn about some famous principles of security
design from two people named Saltzer and Schroeder: <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Security Principles</a>

You're going to see these guy's names a lot, and their "8 Design
Principles" are considered required reading by many. I am not having you
read the paper they originally introduced them in as it is quite long,
but if you are super interested you can read part A of this <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/Basic.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">big ole paper</a>. (Not B, it's super
boring and academic-y.)

Tasks:

1.  Describe the difference between privacy and security and how they
    relate to each other.
2.  List Saltzer and Schroeder's 8 Design Principles and describe why
    each is important in the context of passwords and authentication.
3.  Describe why psychological acceptability is the most important of
    all of these design principles.
