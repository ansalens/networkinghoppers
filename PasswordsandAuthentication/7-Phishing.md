You've been on the internet long enough to know what phishing is so I
won't explain this too much.

You can always get tricked with a good email or malicious link that
leads you to a login page. Always, always, always, always look at the
full URL. Green locks and any other bells and whistles won't help you.
But.... there is always a small chance that your DNS is being hijacked
(what's that? Google "DNS hijacking") and the URL is right, in which
case your browser will tell you that the HTTPS key has changed. Long
story short, use a modern updated browser, listen to your browser and
think. It's happened to me, it might happen to you, just don't lose your
email account or your password manager.

One of the biggest things you can do to avoid getting phished is to
learn what a phishing attempt looks like. Read this: <a

If you get a phish, good chance other people are getting it as well. So
you need to report it! Make sure you know how to report to your
organization to protect everyone else!

# Phishing and 2FA

It still works if you give them your 2FA credentials. Sorry.
