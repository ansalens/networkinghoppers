In Secure Yourself Now I just had you do the highest impact activities
possible to minimize your risk... but what is risk?

Risk is a somewhat quantifiable function of the likelihood of the
vulnerability being exploited and the impact it would cause the
organization if the vulnerability is exploited.

A common equation for risk is:

``` default
 Risk = Probability of Threat x Impact of Vulnerability 
```

`or even more simply:`

``` default
 Risk = Probability x Loss
```

Let's define the rest of the equation.

A threat is anything that has the potential to disrupt the normal
functioning of an organization or in general cause harm to the
organization. Determining the probability of a threat is a very
difficult proposition.

A vulnerability is a defect in a process, system, infrastructure, or
procedure that can be exploited to cause harm to the organization by an
external or internal actor. Identifying vulnerabilities is
straightforward, but identifying the potential impact is even more
difficult than trying to determine the probability of a threat. If you
can identify the impact, you have the most important part of the
equation locked down. Splitting out asset value helps us focus in on the
importance of identifying impact, rather than getting focused on
potential threats and vulnerabilities. 

Each decision you make can be based on this equation, and big decisions
are actually a combination of hundreds of these risk equations. Then,
based on what your acceptable level of risk is, you make your decisions.

It is almost impossible to completely rid a system of risks without
affecting its operability. There is always a constant battle to find the
balance between security and functionality, and as the person who is
managing risk, it is on them to determine the balance point. In a world
of perfect security, availability falls to the wayside, and people who
need information can't get it. Being a security professional means
weighing the costs and benefits of risk.

Briefly, ignoring the hundreds of frameworks and complex policy papers,
the risk management process consists of the following general steps:

As it is a cycle, after the feedback stage we can determine whether the
mitigation that was put in place was effective and the cycle continues.
Risk management is very complicated, but using a framework as a mental
model is a good start. <img

Answer these questions:

1.  What is a threat?
2.  What is a vulnerability?
3.  How do we define asset value?
