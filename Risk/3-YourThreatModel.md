# Your Threat Model
Now, I don't know you so I don't want to tell you what your threat model is. 

Here's a list of  specific guides for specific threat models from sources I trust:

* [LGBTQ Youth](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/lgbtq-youth)
* [Domestic Violence](https://hackblossom.org/domestic-violence/)
* [Stalkerware](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware/2019/07/helping-survivors-of-domestic-abuse-what-to-do-when-you-find-stalkerware/)
* [Journalist](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/journalist-move)
* [Activist](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/activist-or-protester)
* [Human Rights Defender](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/human-rights-defender)


If you have specific threat models listed above, these should have good information for you. If you have a non-specific threat model, the rest of this course will have everything you need.
