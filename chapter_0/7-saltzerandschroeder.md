Tasks:

1. Describe the difference between privacy and security and how they relate to each other.
2. List Saltzer and Schroeder's 8 Design Principles and describe why each is important. 
3. Describe why psychological acceptability is the most important of all of these design principles.


You're going to see these guy's names a lot, the paper where they introduced these ideas is widely regarded as the most cited paper in security. I am not having you read the paper they originally introduced them in as it is quite long, but if you are super interested you can read part A of this <http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/Basic.html>. (Not B, it's super boring.)
