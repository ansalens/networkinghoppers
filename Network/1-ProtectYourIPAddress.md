# Protect Your IP Address
If you make a request to a website or send/receive any data across the internet, you have given your router's IP address. This request can take any form, from a visiting a link, viewing an image hosted there, or being redirected through a short link. You can also be tricked into opening a file that sends a request out to the internet, running a program which profiles your computer and sends out a request, or even running a terrible DDOS tool that makes no attempt to hide that it is running on your own network. An attacker can use these requests to identify someone through a 3rd party service.
