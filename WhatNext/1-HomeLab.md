# Home Lab

All those little labs on your own box are good, but the next step after
attaining enough technical knowledge to be dangerous is to build a home
lab. Once there are multiple computers you own in the mix throwing
packets at eachother, the amount you can learn rapidly scales up.

  

A home lab doesn’t mean you need server racks, just at least a computer
that can run 2+ VMs at a time. This is the best resource on the topic by
a significant margin: [Building Virtual Machine Labs: A Hands-on Guide
(Second Edition) ](https://leanpub.com/avatar2). The author is
absolutely awesome and is a supporter of this site. 

It is pay what you want, so pay what you want, and then set up
everything that seems interesting, focusing on the security products. In
this book you will set up a full network, along with Kali and
Metasploitable. What is important is that you will learn how to use
Metasploit, but only so that you can create good logs for your security
monitoring setup.

As I mentioned, I just want you looking at packets.
